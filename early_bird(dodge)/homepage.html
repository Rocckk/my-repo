					<h4>Dodge Challenger</h4>
					<p>The Dodge Challenger is the name of three different generations of American automobiles marketed by the Dodge division of Chrysler.
					The Dodge Silver Challenger was produced from 1958 to 1959. From 1969 to 1974, the first generation Dodge Challenger pony car was
					built using the Chrysler E platform, sharing major components with the Plymouth Barracuda. The second generation, from 1978 to 
					1983, was a badge engineered Mitsubishi Galant Lambda. The third, and current generation, was introduced in early 2008 as a rival
					to the evolved fifth generation Ford Mustang and the fifth generation Chevrolet Camaro.</p>
					<h4>First generation (1970–1974)</h4>
					<p>The Challenger was described in a book about 1960s American cars as Dodge's "answer to the Mustang and Camaro." Introduced in 
					fall 1969 for the 1970 model year, it was one of two Chrysler E-body cars, the other being the slightly smaller Plymouth
					Barracuda. "Both the Challenger and Barracuda were available in a staggering number of trim and option levels" and were intended 
					"to compete against cars like the Chevrolet Camaro and Ford Mustang, and to do it while offering virtually every engine in
					Chrysler's inventory." However, the 1970 Challenger was "a rather late response to the ponycar wave the Ford Mustang had started"
					with its introduction in April 1964. In his book Hemi Muscle Cars, Robert Genat wrote that the Challenger was conceived in the
					late 1960s as Dodge's equivalent of the Plymouth Barracuda, and that the Barracuda was designed to compete against the Mustang.
					The 1964 Barracuda was actually the first car in this sporty car segment by a few weeks, but was quickly overshadowed by the
					release of the segment defining Mustang (the segment being referred to as "Pony Car"). He added that Chrysler intended the new 
					1970 Dodge as "the most potent ponycar ever," and positioned it "to compete against the Mercury Cougar and Pontiac Firebird."
					Genat also noted that the "Barracuda was intended to compete in the marketplace with the Mustang and Camaro/Firebird, while the 
					Dodge was to be positioned against the Cougar" and other more luxury-type musclecars.</p>
					<h4>Second generation (1978–1983)</h4>
					<p>The Challenger name was revived in 1978 for a version of the early Mitsubishi Galant Lambda coupe. It was known overseas as the Mitsubishi 
					Sapporo/Scorpion and sold through Dodge dealers as a captive import. It was identical except in color and minor trim to the Plymouth Sapporo 
					with the Dodge version emphasizing sportiness, with bright colors and tape stripes, while the Plymouth emphasized luxury, with more subdued
					trim. The cars were slightly restyled in 1981 with revised headlights and other minor cosmetic changes. Both cars were sold until 1984, until
					being replaced by the Conquest and Daytona.</p>
					<h4>Third generation (2008–present)</h4>
					<p>The Dodge Challenger Concept was unveiled at the 2006 Detroit Motor Show and was a preview for the 3rd generation Dodge
					Challenger that started its production in 2007. Many design cues of the Dodge Challenger Concept were adapted from the 1970 
					Dodge Challenger R/T.</p>
